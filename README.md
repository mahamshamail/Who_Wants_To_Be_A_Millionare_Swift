General rules: 

For each question, the game must randomly select a question and it’s option for a bank of questions.

Please note, for both difficulty options, players are allowed 3 lifelines which are:
Call a friend- This lifeline allows the game to eliminate two incorrect answers.
Ask the Audience- This lifeline allows the player to “ask the audience” for the correct answer. Be creative with regards to how you implement this. 
Phone a friend - This lifeline allows the player to “phone to a friend” for the correct answer. Be creative with regards to how you implement this.

The lifelines are only available in round 2 and round 3 for players who chose the hard option, whereas all lifelines are available from round 1 to players who chose the easy option. 

After the player chooses their answer for any given question, they must be allowed to confirm that the choice selected is their final answer. If the user doesn't confirm their choice then they can change their answer to another option.

Once the user incorrectly answers a question they will lose the game and walk away with no money.

Lastly, please note, your application MUST be coded in the context of Object Oriented Programming, thus, you must have an appropriate Class Model for the aforementioned scenario.
